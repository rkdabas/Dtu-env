//         <p>The environmental engineers from the Department of Environmental Engineering, DTU are heading the multidisciplinary teams which are engaged in solving the most challenging issues related to climate change, sustainability, access to safe drinking water, air quality management, waste recovery & recycling, renewable energy, green infrastructure etc. It is my pleasure to introduce you to the credentials being earned by the department during its journey of about 20 years in the University. With the inception of postgraduate course (M. Tech. in Environmental Engineering) in 1982 and Undergraduate course (B. Tech. in Environmental Engineering) in 1998, the department has grown horizontally and vertically in key areas of environment. The strong alumni base of the Department is a testimony to the laurels earned in industries, public sector undertakings, government agencies, pollution control boards, academics, and research organisations.
// <br></br>
// Presently, apart from the intake of 70 students in B.Tech. and 20 students in M.Tech., about 25 full-time Ph.D. Scholars are engaged on research in broad areas of waste management, environmental modelling and simulation, air quality management, wastewater treatment, ecological engineering, and advanced oxidation processes. The laboratories harbour state of the art modern facilities for training and cutting-edge research in collaboration with various national and international institutes. Further, students are continuously exposed to the real-life field problems through internships, industrial visits, and consultancy projects. The very able and committed members of the faculty, with diverse backgrounds, have laid a strong foundation to get the present-day recognition to the department. My sincere appeal to the faculty, students, alumni, and other stakeholders to keep contributing to help raise the standard of the department, and maintain the highest standards of moral values and professional ethics.
// <br></br>
// I feel immense pleasure to invite students, scholars, researchers, academicians, and people from industry to collaborate with the department to further strengthen its capacity and capabilities in academics, research, training, consultancy, and employment.</p>
